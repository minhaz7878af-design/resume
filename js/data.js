    summary:
      "I build production AI systems end-to-end — from multi-agent LLM architectures and RAG infrastructure to Dockerized deployment and streaming APIs. At Synexia AI I shipped EDIA, a 17-node LangGraph decision-intelligence platform covering 19 petrochemical products, and Zhanlu, a governed multi-agent runtime with 144 registered tools and sandboxed execution. My master's thesis, BEPSBot, applied the same systems thinking to a sensitive domain: a draft-grounded AI writing assistant for mental-health peer support, validated in a 24-participant study.",

      "I believe LLMs should narrate, never calculate — so I build deterministic guardrails, verified tool pipelines, and human oversight into every system, from enterprise forecasting to mental-health communication.",

      "I'm an M.Eng. candidate at Zhejiang University (Industrial Design Engineering) with a B.Eng. in Computer Science from Yunnan University. Over the past two years I've worked as an AI Infrastructure & Systems Engineer at Synexia AI, where I built two production platforms from the ground up.",
      "EDIA pre-computes every business-critical metric in deterministic Python before any LLM narrates it, cutting decision-workflow latency from up to 478 seconds down to 30–45 seconds. Zhanlu is a multi-tenant platform for governed, tool-using AI agents, with permission-filtered tool dispatch, Docker-sandboxed execution, MCP integrations, and full audit trails.",
      "Alongside engineering, I conduct human-centered AI research. My thesis, BEPSBot (HHME 2026 PCC), showed that draft-grounded generation more than doubled suggestion adoption (33.3% → 75.6%) while preserving usability (SUS 86.98) — published alongside two ICEC 2025 papers on bipolar-disorder biomarkers and biofeedback interventions.",
      "I'm looking for engineering roles where I can own LLM and agent systems from architecture to deployment, in domains where correctness and trust matter.",

        <p>As the sole developer during my Synexia AI internship, I designed and implemented the agent configuration and execution components, document retrieval, structured-data analysis, Skills/MCP integrations, context and memory management, model routing, and full-stack interfaces.</p>
        <p>My primary contributions included:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Building the Agent Builder and runtime: agent instructions, model routes, data/knowledge bindings, tools, bounded loops, delegated runs, and persisted state.</li>
          <li>Implementing document RAG: upload, parsing, chunking, local embeddings, ChromaDB indexing, retrieval with source references, and indexing failure states.</li>
          <li>Developing the structured business-data path: <code>GroundedPlan → validated SQL → CanonicalResultSet</code> with deterministic temporal parsing, metric contracts, query validation and result-grain controls.</li>
          <li>Integrating Skills and MCP: discovery, routing, progressive loading, parameter validation, permission filtering, and external tool connections.</li>
          <li>Building context and memory: project-scoped semantic recall, history compression, context budgeting, and references to large tool results.</li>
          <li>Adding automation and artifacts: scheduled agent execution, run history, and generated dashboards/documents with version history and preview checks.</li>
          <li>Integrating model serving: vLLM/Qwen3-27B integration validation, model routes, and provider fallback — on top of FastAPI, React, PostgreSQL, Redis, MinIO and containerized workers.</li>

              <li><b>Planner FSM</b> — plan-act-observe state machine around a swappable LLM; emits Plan DAGs and records planning, action, observation and verification signals. Verification currently affects evaluation and confidence reporting; automatic reflection and replanning remain incomplete.</li>
              <li><b>Harness Agent Runtime</b> — programmatic and delegated agent runs use the structured harness with required-confirmations, risk tier, model route, sandbox requirement, missing-permission schema, dangerous-side-effect list, and ready / warning / blocked status. The primary conversational path currently uses a separate execution loop and is being migrated toward the same runtime contract.</li>
              <li><b>Memory &amp; Knowledge</b> — document RAG (ChromaDB + local embeddings) and project-isolated context with provenance.</li>
              <li><b>Execution Layer</b> — sandbox-worker is the only Docker-socket-bearing service; dedicated sandbox-python / sandbox-pptx / sandbox-office / sandbox-webapp containers for selected workloads.</li>

            <p>Calls routed through the structured harness pass through permission filtering, schema validation, policy evaluation, and execution controls before reaching a tool or MCP server.

            <h3 class="pd-subh">Document RAG</h3>
            <p>Uploaded documents go through parsing, chunking, and local embedding before ChromaDB indexing. Retrieval combines semantic and keyword search with knowledge-base access-policy filtering, and answers carry source references. Indexing failures surface as explicit states rather than silent gaps.</p>

            <p>This section is intentionally placed at the end. The CAD Agent is an <em>extension</em> of the same harness, not the main story. It reuses the Planner, the Tool / Skill / MCP Gateway, the sandbox worker, and the audit trail to apply them to a different domain: design engineering.</p>
